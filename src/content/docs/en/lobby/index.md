# Profile

When you open your profile, you will have three pages available. There you can change your appearance, your cosmetics and much more. In addition, you can manage your friends on these pages, turn welcome messages on and off, view bans and kicks, and change your language.
# Paper

You can change the lobby using the paper found in the 9th slot of your hotbar. Hold the paper in your hand and right-click to change the lobby.
