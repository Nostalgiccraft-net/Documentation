# BorderRun

In BorderRun, your main task is to escape from the constantly approaching border. You can set traps for other players to slow them down. The last surviving player wins the game.
To slow down other players, you have various items in your inventory. You can use these items with the right mouse button. The items include:

- **Jetpack**: With the jetpack, you can propel yourself into the air and fly over obstacles. This can be particularly useful when you need to cover a large distance quickly.
- **Grappling Hook**: With the grappling hook, you can cling to blocks and pull yourself up. This is especially useful when you need to overcome obstacles that you can't bypass.
- **Goal Compass**: The goal compass always shows you the way to the next goal. This is especially useful when you're not sure which direction to continue running.
- **Cobwebs**: Use cobwebs to slow down other players. Place them strategically to hinder the movement of your opponents.
- **Slowness Potion**: With the slowness potion, you can slow down other players. This can be particularly useful when you're being pursued and need to gain some distance.
