The Job System allows you to create new jobs. There are three different types of jobs:

- **Gathering Jobs**
- **Sales Jobs**
- **Classified Ads**

### Gathering Jobs

Through the Gathering Job, other players can collect resources for you and sell them to you through the menu (GUI). You
determine both the price and the quantity of the desired resources. Creating a job requires a fee equal to the value of
the desired resources (for example, 1000 blocks of wood = 1000 coins), plus a small fee for job creation. You must pay
this amount in advance before the job is created. If you created a job that is not fully filled and it expires, the
remaining amount will be refunded to your account. You can conveniently retrieve the items through the GUI.

### Sales Jobs

With the Sales Job, you can offer your resources for sale to other players. You determine both the price and the
quantity of the item/resource. Creating a job requires a fee for both its creation and duration. The items you want to
sell are taken from you until they are sold or the job expires. Items that are not sold within the duration of your job
can be retrieved in the menu (GUI).

### Classified Ads

Through Classified Ads, you can offer a variety of things: services, items, properties, etc. Creating a classified ad
requires a fee for its creation and duration, as well as the price you're asking for your offer. If your classified ad
expires without finding any interested parties, the amount will be refunded to your account. Except if you offered an
item â€“ in that case, you can retrieve it in the menu (GUI). Keep in mind that the fee for creating a classified ad is
deducted in advance and is not refunded if you delete the ad prematurely or if you don't find any interested parties.
