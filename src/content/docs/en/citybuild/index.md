title: What is CityBuild?
description: Here you can find information about how NostalgicCity works.
---
In CityBuild you can build a small area (=a plot) of a large world with your friends. You can buy these plots using our in-game currency. You will find out how to do this on the following pages. You can access a universal menu with all sub-items, the PMenu, by pressing **/p**. Here you can also find all commands in button form.



## Claiming a plot for yourself
There are two ways to claim a plot for yourself: **Automatic** and **Manual assignment**.
Automatic assignment is easier to start with. This gives you a random, unoccupied plot.
To obtain a plot via **automatic assignment**, use **/p auto**.
The **manual assignment** works by standing on an unoccupied plot and using the **/p claim** command. This is useful if you want to claim a plot next to another one of your own or that of a friend.
You can claim a maximum of 2 plots for free. You can buy more via the PMenu.



## Basic functions
- You can visit other players' plots with the command **/p h** or **/p v**.
