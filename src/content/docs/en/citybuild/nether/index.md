The main function of the Nether is to collect resources and food, which you can then use on the Citybuild server to construct buildings. You can also sell these materials for money. The Nether resets every 24 hours so that you can keep collecting new resources.
In the Nether, you also have the option of mining spawners to obtain spawner eggs. You can place these eggs in the Farm World, Nether and Plot World or use them in an existing spawner to change the spawn properties and make the desired mob appear.

## Assurances
As in the farm world, you also have the option in the Nether to purchase various protective insurances from the insurance NPC at the spawn to protect you from losing your inventory. There are different options to choose from, including 1-hour, 2-hour, 5-hour, 10-hour or 24-hour insurance policies, which are available for a fee. Of course, you can also purchase several and they will be added to your current term. If you lose your inventory or coins despite having taken out insurance, you can contact support to request a refund.
